            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600;">About Kagumo High School</h2>
            <p>
                Kagumo High School is a boy's national secondary school located between Kirichu and Kiganjo townships at Kagumo near Karatina on the Nyeri-Nanyuki road in Kenya.
                It was one of the first schools in Kenya to allow native black Africans to sit for university level entrance exams, doing so in 1946.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is one of the best high schools in Kenya, with prominent old boys in Kenya and globally. 
                It has several notable alumni including lawyers, doctors and politicians such as the constitutional lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria.
            </p>
             <p>
                In academics, sports and creative arts this school has a long-standing rivalry with Nyeri High School, with meetings between the two schools, particularly in rugby, and basketball the most intense.

                    â€“ Dr. Silas Mwirigi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kagumo is a great school. It has a rich history with prominent alumni and teachers. I am pleased to be part of this school and part of those that will execute the current and future programs of the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also appreciate that the school has very focused stakeholders. The Board of Management, the Parents, teaching and non-teaching staff, and the Old Boys have demonstrated their commitment to the school and the community they serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role is to provide leadership, chart a direction and the course the school will take to fulfill its mandate, and make it one of the best performing school in the republic, and in this, i will not disappoint. I am committed to offering leadership based on consultation, where we bring everyone on board as a member of one great family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve this, I appeal for support from all stakeholders -of the school. I assure you that everyone has a place in making the school great and any contributions in this endeavor is welcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our first goal is academic excellence. All other activities are meant to serve the results our students get in examinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second goal is to provide infrastructure that reflects the greatness of the school. The third goal is to appropriately cater for the welfare of the students, the teachers and the non-teaching staff. This is geared at making everyone comfortable and productive. It is my desire to see everyone develop career wise, and grow socially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe these will give Kagumo High School the national school image, performance and recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these we trust in the Almighty God`s blessings for fulfillment.
                </p>

                                Kagumo High School needs no introduction in this country. It is a recognizable brand 
                                within and beyond the borders of this great republic. But like any other institution, 
                                it has had its highs and lows. After surprisingly fading a little, stakeholders have 
                                injected a dose of new impetus to rejuvenate this academic giant.
