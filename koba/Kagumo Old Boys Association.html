                        Cabinet Secretary James W. Macharia heads the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure. He joined Kagumo in 1977 for his A-levels and resided in Kimathi House.
                        He is most proud of Kagumo because it trained him to become an independent person. Discipline and the wide scope of Kagumo old boys do provide a rich platform for networking.
                        As a way of giving back to the school, Mr. Macharia in his own capacity has contributed towards the project of renovating Wilberforce and Washington Houses.
