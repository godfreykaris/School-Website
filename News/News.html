                <p>The Ministry of Education is exploring ways and means of institutionalizing chaplaincy services in Basic education institutions in the country.</p>
                <p>Jointly with the National Committee on Chaplaincy, the Ministry is working a framework under which chaplains can offer spiritual and moral guidance to learners in Basic Education institutions,</p>

                <p>Mr. Duale said the Ministry and FBO looks forward to ensuring that chaplains helping students to cope with the ambiguities and complexities of life. He said inability to cope with stress and anxieties has capacity to disorient students who eventually engage in self destructive behavior,</p><p>He said the presence of chaplains will provide a listening ear and a caring presence for learners grappling with crisis of one kind or another or simply be around for those who need a friend to listen to.</p><p>Mr. Duale said the spiritual and moral guidance that the Chaplains will give will help prevent learners to adopt behavior that is destructive to them and also to schools and society at large.</p><p>Mr., Duale said the National Committee on Chaplains Services, which is chaired by National Association of Christian Chaplains, Rev John Gatu, has the mandate to develop guidelines on the delivery of chaplainâ€™s services in schools.</p><p>Committee Chairman, Rev John Gatu is also the secretary of the National Association of Christian Chaplains (NACC).</p><p>Mr. Duale said the Committee, which draws membership from Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM), National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Seventh-day Adventist (S.D.A), Evangelical Alliance of Kenya (E.A.K), Presbyterian Church of East Africa (P.C.E.A), HINDU Council and the Ministry of Education.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: 600; text-align: center;">Integrity in administration of exams</p>
                <p>Migori March 28, 2021</p>
                <p>The Principal Secretary for Early Learning Basic Education and early learning Dr. Julius Jwan has said cheating in examinations messes up the careers and lives of the students.</p>
                <p>He said the students who end up getting marks or grades through cheating drop out in university programmes they are admitted or repeat many times before they complete the programmes.</p>
                <p>Dr. Jwan made the remarks at &nbsp;Sori high school in Migori County, after witnessing the sealing of the mathematics paper.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The PS had earlier witnessed the opening of the exam container at the Nyatike Deputy County Commissioner's office before monitoring Kiboun, Ageng'e, Lwanda Magar, Gunga secondary schools in Migori County today.</p>
                <p>Dr Jwan noted that cheating produces graduates that lack integrity and in many cases the competencies needed in many spheres of human life.</p>
                <p>Dr. Jwan said proper curriculum management and delivery had the capacity to make students pass and be able to effectively undertake any academic, professional and technical programmes in tertiary and in university institutions.</p>
                <p>The evil of cheating in examinations, the PS said, lies in making people believe success is gotten through cheating.</p>
                <p>He said this belief messes up the lives of young people most of whom fail to acquire the knowledge, skills and aptitudes they require in the decisions they make about their post-secondary education and training.</p>
                <p>The PS noted that the government is determined to curb exam cheating in the county after several cases were reported in the previous years.</p>                            </div>
