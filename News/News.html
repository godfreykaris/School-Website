                <p style="font-weight: 600; text-align: center;">Integrity in administration of exams</p>
                <p>Migori March 28, 2021</p>
                <p>The Principal Secretary for Early Learning Basic Education and early learning Dr. Julius Jwan has said cheating in examinations messes up the careers and lives of the students.</p>
                <p>He said the students who end up getting marks or grades through cheating drop out in university programmes they are admitted or repeat many times before they complete the programmes.</p>
                <p>Dr. Jwan made the remarks at &nbsp;Sori high school in Migori County, after witnessing the sealing of the mathematics paper.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The PS had earlier witnessed the opening of the exam container at the Nyatike Deputy County Commissioner's office before monitoring Kiboun, Ageng'e, Lwanda Magar, Gunga secondary schools in Migori County today.</p>
                <p>Dr Jwan noted that cheating produces graduates that lack integrity and in many cases the competencies needed in many spheres of human life.</p>
                <p>Dr. Jwan said proper curriculum management and delivery had the capacity to make students pass and be able to effectively undertake any academic, professional and technical programmes in tertiary and in university institutions.</p>
                <p>The evil of cheating in examinations, the PS said, lies in making people believe success is gotten through cheating.</p>
                <p>He said this belief messes up the lives of young people most of whom fail to acquire the knowledge, skills and aptitudes they require in the decisions they make about their post-secondary education and training.</p>
                <p>The PS noted that the government is determined to curb exam cheating in the county after several cases were reported in the previous years.</p>                            </div>
